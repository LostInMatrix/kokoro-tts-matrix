### Voice Paradigms

Kokoro TTS Matrix supports two main approaches to voice assignment:

#### 1. Podcast Style
Each speaker has their own dedicated voice throughout the text. Perfect for dialogues, interviews, or multi-speaker content.

```
[af_bella]Welcome to today's discussion on AI. I'm your host, Bella.
[am_liam]And I'm Liam, joining as a special guest to talk about recent developments.
[af_bella]Let's start with the basics. Liam, what would you say is the most exciting trend?
```

#### 2. Narrator Style
One primary narrator voice with character dialogue in different voices. Ideal for audiobooks and storytelling.

```
The wind howled through the trees as Sarah approached the old house.
[bf_emma]"Hello? Is anyone there?"[/bf_emma] she called out nervously.
A moment passed before she heard a reply from inside.
[am_liam]"I've been waiting for you,"[/am_liam] came a deep voice from the shadows.
```

### Audio Effects

Kokoro Matrix supports various audio effects to enhance your narration:

#### Silence Effect
Add pauses between sections:

```
[effect:silence:2.5]
```
This adds a 2.5 second pause.

#### Sound Effects
Add predefined sound effects:

```
[af_bella]Let me tell you a story.
[effect:chime:80]
[am_liam]Once upon a time...
```
The number after the effect name controls volume (1-100).

#### Background Audio/Music
When enabled in Settings, you can add background audio that plays underneath your narration at a specified volume level.

### Voice Blending Tutorial

1. Go to the "Voice Lab" tab
2. Select primary, secondary, and tertiary voices
3. Adjust weight values for each voice
4. Test with sample text
5. Save your custom blend

### Phoneme Notation

Customize pronunciation using phoneme notation:

```
[Kokoro](/kÀàOk…ô…πO/)
```

### File Preparation Tips

For best results with ebooks:
1. Use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to convert various ebook formats to TXT before processing
2. This provides more reliable text extraction than the built-in EPUB processor
3. Remove any page numbers, headers, or other formatting artifacts before processing
